            Wowee Zowee is the third studio album by American indie rock band Pavement. 
            The album showcased a more experimental and spontaneous side of the group, 
            returning them to the clatter and unpredictability of their early recordings 
            after the more traditional rock sound of 1994's Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain.
